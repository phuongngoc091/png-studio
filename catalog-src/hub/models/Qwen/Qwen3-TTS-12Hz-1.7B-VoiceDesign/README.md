## PNG Studio Notes

Qwen3-TTS 1.7B VoiceDesign in PNG Studio is a voice design workflow. It downloads GGUF models from conversion repository `cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-voicedesign-GGUF`. It needs:
- Backbone: `qwen3-tts-12hz-1.7b-voicedesign-q8_0.gguf`
- Tokenizer: `qwen3-tts-tokenizer-12hz.gguf`

It allows designing unique synthetic voices on the fly by specifying a text style instruction/description alongside the text prompt to synthesize.
